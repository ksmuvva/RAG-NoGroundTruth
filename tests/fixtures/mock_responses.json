    "question": "What is machine learning?",
    "answer": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.",
    "contexts": [
      "Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn.",
      "ML algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values."

  {
    "question": "How does neural network work?",
    "answer": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information using connectionist approaches to computation.",
    "contexts": [
      "A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.",
      "Neural networks can adapt to changing input so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria."
